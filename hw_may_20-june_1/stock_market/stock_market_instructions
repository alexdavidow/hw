require 'yahoofinance'


Pair program and TDD a stock management program which is capable of:
* Create an account for client (name, balance).
* A client can create multiple portfolios.
* A client can buy stocks at market rate; these stocks will be added to a portfolio and the purchase amount subtracted from cash. (You cannot go to a negative cash balance).
* A client can sell a stock. The proceeds go into his account.
* List all client portfolios and their values (each portfolio value and sum of portfolio values) and the account balance.
* List all stocks in a portfolio.
* List all clients.
 
**Note:**
 
Each time a portfolio balance is calculated, the program needs to go out to the web and get current stock prices.
 
Utilize yahoofinance gem, and require it in the necessary ruby files. For example:
 
YahooFinance::get_quotes(YahooFinance::StandardQuote, 'AAPL')['AAPL'].lastTrade
 
=> 453.62


Then if you want to grab a current stock quote from Yahoo Finance's servers, use:
YahooFinance::get_quotes(YahooFinance::StandardQuote, 'AAPL')['AAPL'].lastTrade
where AAPL can be replaced by whichever stock symbol you want
gem install yahoofinance
